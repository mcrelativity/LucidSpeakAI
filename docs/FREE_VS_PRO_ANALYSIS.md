### 2. AUDIO METRICS & ANALYSIS

#### Free Tier
```python
# Current (librosa only)
{
  "duration": 45.5,           # seconds
  "pitch_variation": 45.3     # standard deviation
}
```

#### Pro Tier (New)
```python
# Comprehensive analysis
{
  # Librosa features
  "duration": 45.5,
  "rms_energy": 0.234,              # loudness
  "spectral_centroid": 2145.3,      # brightness
  "zero_crossing_rate": 0.12,       # noise amount
  "mfcc": [array of 13 values],     # speech characteristics
  
  # Parselmouth/Praat prosody
  "pitch": {
    "mean_hz": 156.4,
    "range": {"min": 95, "max": 245},
    "std_deviation": 28.5,
    "contour": [rising, falling, level patterns]
  },
  
  "intensity": {
    "mean_db": 68.5,
    "variation": 3.2,
    "range": {"min": 62.1, "max": 74.8}
  },
  
  "speech_rate": {
    "words_per_minute": 142,
    "syllables_per_second": 3.8,
    "pause_ratio": 0.08
  }
}
```

**What This Enables**:
- Detect vocal strain vs. natural speech
- Identify monotone speakers
- Measure engagement (pitch variation = interest)
- Determine confidence level
- Spot nervousness (faster speech, higher pitch)

---

### 3. FILLER WORD DETECTION

#### Free Tier (Current)
```python
# Text-based matching
{
  "fillers_detected": ["like", "um", "you know"],
  "filler_count": 12,
  "disfluencies_per_minute": 2.8,
  # Only word count, no timestamps
}
```

**Limitations**:
- Misses elongations ("sooooo" → "so")
- Can't distinguish nervous from intentional
- No confidence scoring
- No timing information

#### Pro Tier (New)
```python
# Audio + Text combined
{
  "fillers": [
    {
      "word": "like",
      "count": 12,
      "confidence": 0.94,           # How sure we are
      "timestamps": [2.3, 5.1, 8.7, ...],  # When it occurred
      "audio_pattern": "detected"   # Found in audio too
    },
    {
      "word": "um",
      "count": 8,
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "timestamps": [1.2, 4.5, 10.2, ...],
      "audio_pattern": "detected"
    },
    {
      "word": "uh",
      "count": 3,
      "confidence": 0.72,
      "timestamps": [7.8, 15.3, ...],
      "audio_pattern": "hesitation_pause"  # Different type
    }
  ],
  
  "summary": {
    "total_count": 23,
    "filler_density": 0.048,           # % of words
    "top_3": ["like", "um", "uh"],
    "improvement_needed": true,
    "confidence_average": 0.84
  }
}
```

**What Pro Users Get**:
- Exact timestamps → see WHEN you use fillers
- Confidence scores → know if detection is reliable
- Audio-visual sync → shows up in UI with wave
- Distinction between types → "um" vs pause vs vocal fry
- Actionable data → "you used 'like' 12 times in first 30 seconds"

### 4. EMOTION & TONE DETECTION

#### Free Tier
```python
# Hardcoded rules based on metrics
if pitch_variation > 50 and speech_rate > 140:
    "You seem excited/nervous"
else:
    "You sound confident"
```

**Problems**:
- Binary or simplistic
- No real emotion detection
- Inaccurate

#### Pro Tier (New)
```python
# Transformer model (optional Pro+)
{
  "primary_emotion": "confident",
  "secondary_emotion": "engaged",
  "confidence": 0.78,
  
  "emotion_scores": {
    "happy": 0.65,
    "confident": 0.78,
    "anxious": 0.12,
    "sad": 0.05,
    "angry": 0.02,
    "neutral": 0.15
  },
  
  "tone_analysis": {
    "formal": true,
    "professional": true,
    "authoritative": false,
    "empathetic": true
  }
}
```

**What This Reveals**:
- Actual emotional tone (not just calculated)
- Professional vs casual assessment
- Authenticity/alignment (do words match emotions?)
- Multiple emotions present
- Confidence of analysis

---

### 5. AI-POWERED INSIGHTS

#### Free Tier (Current)
```python
# Hardcoded template-based system
if disfluencies > threshold:
    action = "CRITICAL: Record 30 seconds. Count fillers..."
elif pitch_variation < low:
    action = "Improve dynamics: Mark 3 key words..."
else:
    action = "Your tone is good, now make it strategic..."
    
return generic_suggestions[context][language]
```

**Problems**:
- Generic advice
- No personalization
- Not learning from data
- Limited to predefined categories

#### Pro Tier (New)
```python
# GPT-4 synthesis of ALL metrics
Prompt sent to GPT: """
Analyze this speech:
- Transcript: "..."
- Pitch: 95-245 Hz (wide range, good variation)
- Speech rate: 142 WPM (slightly fast)
- Fillers: 12 'like', 8 'um' (above average)
- Emotions: Confident (78%) but Anxious (12%)
- Context: Job interview for engineering role
- Goal: Persuade hiring manager

Provide:
1. What went well?
2. What needs work?
3. Specific, actionable recommendations
4. Score: Communication effectiveness (1-10)
"""

# GPT Response (example):
{
  "summary": "You have excellent pitch variation and engagement, which is great for an interview. However, your filler words are a concern - 20 in 45 seconds suggests nervousness even though your prosody suggests confidence. This mismatch suggests you're anxious despite sounding composed.",
  
  "strengths": [
    "Excellent pitch variation (95-245Hz) - keeps listener engaged",
    "Good speaking pace (142 WPM) - appropriate for content",
    "Demonstrates confidence through prosody despite nervous fillers"
  ],
  
  "improvements": [
    "Reduce filler words - currently 23/minute (2x average)",
    "Bridge the confidence gap - your voice is good, manage the anxiety",
    "Emphasis: You technically sound great but FEEL nervous"
  ],
  
  "recommendations": [
    "Before interview: Practice "pause instead of um" technique",
    "During interview: When you feel the urge to say 'like', take a breath instead",
    "After interview: If anxiety persists, practice stress-management techniques",
    "Next practice: Record in front of mirror - visual feedback helps anxiety"
  ],
  
  "scores": {
    "communication_effectiveness": 7.8,
    "confidence_projection": 8.5,
    "interview_readiness": 6.9,
    "areas_to_work": ["Nervousness", "Filler words"]
  }
}
```

**What Pro Users Get**:
- AI understands context (job interview ≠ casual talk)
- Personalized based on YOUR metrics (not generic)
- Identifies gaps (you sound confident but feel anxious)
- Specific, actionable advice
- Scoring and benchmarking

## Use Case Examples

### Example 1: Job Interview Prep

**Free User**:
```
"You have good pitch variation and moderate fillers.
Try to reduce filler words. Good luck!"
```

**Pro User**:
```
"Your pitch variation (7.8/10) is excellent and projects confidence. 
However, you use 'like' 12 times - a 2x frequency vs professionals. 
This creates a confidence-anxiety gap: you SOUND assured but FEEL nervous.

Recommendation: Practice pausing for 1 second instead of saying 'like'. 
Your brain will self-correct. Do this for 5 minutes daily for 2 weeks.

Interview readiness: 6.9/10 - Improve filler frequency to reach 8+."
```

---

### Example 2: Pitch Improvement

**Free User**:
```
"Your pitch variation is 42 semitones. Try to vary your tone more."
```

**Pro User**:
```
"Your pitch varies 42 semitones (excellent range). However, analysis shows:
- First 50% of speech: High pitch (156-180 Hz) - projects energy
- Second 50% of speech: Low pitch (100-120 Hz) - sounds tired
- Your voice 'drops' when discussing personal achievements

Interpretation: You're most engaged early, lose momentum later.
Recommendation: Reorder your content - start with impact, build energy."
```
