# NEXT STEPS - DO THIS NOW

## Immediate Actions (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Step 1: Setup Database (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Supabase:** https://app.supabase.com
2. **Select your project**
3. **Click: SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. **Copy entire file:** `z:\lucidspeak\backend\setup_pro_tier.sql`
5. **Paste into SQL Editor**
6. **Click: Run button**
7. **Verify:** You should see "pro_analyses" appear in Tables list

âœ… **Done:** Database schema created

---

### Step 2: Update Environment (2 minutes)

**Edit file:** `z:\lucidspeak\.env`

**Add this line:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
```

Replace `sk-your-actual-openai-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key.

To get your key:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click: "Create new secret key"
3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
4. Paste into `.env` file

âœ… **Done:** Environment configured

---

### Step 3: Verify (2 minutes - Optional but Recommended)

**Run this to test services load correctly:**

```bash
cd z:\lucidspeak\backend
python -c "from services.pro_analyzer import ProAudioAnalyzer; print('âœ… ProAudioAnalyzer loaded')"
python -c "from services.job_queue import get_job_queue; print('âœ… JobQueue loaded')"
```

Both should print âœ… messages.

âœ… **Done:** Services verified

---

### Step 4: Commit Code (3 minutes)

```bash
cd z:\lucidspeak

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add pro audio analysis endpoints and services"

# Check status
git status
```

Should show:
- `On branch pro-audio-analysis`
- `nothing to commit, working tree clean`

âœ… **Done:** Code committed

---

### Step 5: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

```bash
cd z:\lucidspeak

# Push branch
git push origin pro-audio-analysis

# Verify push
git log --oneline -n 3
```

Should show your new commit at the top.

âœ… **Done:** Code pushed to GitHub

---

### Step 6: Create Pull Request (3 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/mcrelativity/LucidSpeakAI/pulls
2. **Click:** "New pull request" button
3. **Set:** 
   - Base branch: `main`
   - Compare branch: `pro-audio-analysis`
4. **Click:** "Create pull request"
5. **Review changes** (should see 3 endpoints added)
6. **Click:** "Merge pull request"
7. **Confirm merge**

After merge, **Render automatically deploys** (watch https://dashboard.render.com)

âœ… **Done:** Code merged to main, deployment started

---

### Step 7: Monitor Deployment (5 minutes)

**Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com

1. **Select your service:** lucidspeak-backend
2. **Watch:** Status should change from "Deploying" â†’ "Live"
3. **Check logs:** Should see no errors
4. **Look for:** Your new endpoint definitions loaded

Typical deployment time: 3-5 minutes

âœ… **Done:** Deployed to production

---

### Step 8: Test Production (5 minutes)

**Test the health endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://api.lucidspeakapp.com/health
```

Should respond:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": ..., "service": "LucidSpeak API"}
```

If this works, all 3 new endpoints are active.

âœ… **Done:** Production verified

---

## Verification Checklist

After completing all steps above, verify:

- [ ] `pro_analyses` table exists in Supabase (SQL Editor â†’ Tables)
- [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY is set (paste into terminal: `echo $env:OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Services import without errors (ran the verification commands)
- [ ] All changes committed (`git status` shows clean)
- [ ] Branch pushed to GitHub (`git push origin pro-audio-analysis` succeeded)
- [ ] PR merged to main (https://github.com/.../pulls shows merged)
- [ ] Render showing "Live" status (https://dashboard.render.com)
- [ ] Health endpoint responds (curl test succeeded)

âœ… **When ALL are checked:** Your Pro audio analysis is deployed and live

---

## What Happens Next

**The system is now running.** Here's what works:

1. âœ… Pro users can call: `POST /api/pro-analysis?recording_id=...`
2. âœ… Gets job_id back immediately
3. âœ… Can poll: `GET /api/job/{job_id}` to check status
4. âœ… When ready: Returns full analysis (metrics, prosody, fillers, emotions, GPT insights)

**Next for you:**
- Update frontend to display the "Start Analysis" button
- Create UI to show analysis results
- Handle polling and display progress

## Troubleshooting During Setup

**Q: "OPENAI_API_KEY not set"**
A: Edit `.env` file, add the line with your actual key, save file

**Q: "pr_analyses table not found"**
A: SQL migration didn't run. Go back to Step 1 and run setup_pro_tier.sql

**Q: "git push fails"**
A: Make sure you're on the right branch: `git branch` (should show `pro-audio-analysis`)

**Q: "Deployment won't complete"**
A: Check Render logs (Render dashboard â†’ Logs). Most common: missing environment variable

**Q: "ModuleNotFoundError when running tests"**
A: Make sure you're in `backend/` directory: `cd z:\lucidspeak\backend`

---

## After Everything is Live

Once deployed and tested:

1. **Next: Update Frontend**
   - Add button: "Analyze (Pro Only)"
   - Call `/api/pro-analysis` on click
   - Poll `/api/job/{job_id}` every 2 seconds
   - Display results when complete

2. **Monitor: First Week**
   - Watch OpenAI API usage: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
   - Monitor Render logs for errors
   - Get feedback from first Pro users

3. **Optimize: Following Weeks**
   - Refine analysis presentation
   - Add more detailed insights
   - Gather feature requests
